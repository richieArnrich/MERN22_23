Scope of a variable:
The scope of a variable is the region of the program 
where the variable is defined and can be accessed.

Types of scope in javascript
1. Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in global scope. They can
be accessed from anywhere in the program.
2. Local scope: Variables declared inside a function or block are in local scope. They can only
be accessed within that function or block.
3. Block scope: Variables declared inside a block (like if, else, for, while)
are in block scope. They can only be accessed within that block.

Closure:
A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of its outer functions,
even when the outer function has returned.
