Async and await in JS
async/await is a syntax sugar for promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and
feels like synchronous code.

Async keyword:
The async keyword is used to declare a function that returns a promise. 
When a function is declared as async, it returns a promise automatically.

Await keyword:
The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the code until the promise is resolved or rejected.
It expects a promise to be resolved always.
It is always used in async functions
