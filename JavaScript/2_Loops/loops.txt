Loop: A set of statements executed multiple times
In Js there three basic loops:
1. While loop
2. Do while loop
3. For loop
--------------------------------------------
### While Loop
    Executes a block of statement until a given condition becomes false

    Syntax: 
    initialisation
    while(condition){
        //code to be executed
        update (increment/decrement)
    }

    Working of while loop:
    1. The initialisation statement is executed first.
    2. The condition is checked. If it is true, the code within the while loop is executed
    3. The update statement is executed.
    4. The condition is checked again. If it is true, the code within the while loop is executed
    5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the condition becomes false.

Questions to solve:
1. Write a program to find factors of a given number
2. Write a program to find the number of factors of a given number
3. Write a program to find whether a number is prime number or not
4. Write a program to find the even factors of a number
5. Write a program to find the prime factors of a number
6. Write a program to whether a number is perfect number or not
    Perfect number means: sum of all factors = twice the given number
    Eg : 28; the factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28
    Whose sum is 56 i.e twice(28)
7. Write a program to reverse a number
    Num: 4365, output: 5634
8. Write a program to find whether a given number is palindrome or not
    Num: 121 output: 121
9. Write a program to find the number of digits in a given number
    Num : 4365 digits: 4
10. Write a program to find the sum of all digits in a given number
    Num : 4365, sumOfAllDigits: 18
---------------------------------------------------------------
### Do While Loop
    Executes a block of statement until a given condition becomes false
    Syntax:
    initialisation
    do{
        //code to be executed
        update (increment/decrement)
    }while(condition);
    
    Working of do while loop
    1. Initialisation takes place
    2. The code within the do while loop is executed first.
    3. The update statment is executed
    4. The condition is checked. If it is true, the code within the do while loop is executed again
    5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the condition becomes false.
---------------------------------------------------------------
### For Loop
    Executes a block of statement for a specified number of times
    Syntax:
        for(initialisation; condition; update){
            //code to be executed
        }
    
    Working Of For Loop
    1. Initialisation takes place
    2. The condition is checked. If it is true, the code within the for loop is executed
    3. The update statement is executed
    4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the condition becomes false.
