What is react?
React is a front-end library used to build interactive webpages
It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-----------------------
Advantages of react
*   Easy to learn and use
*   Fast and efficient
*   Large community of developers
*   Supports server-side rendering
*   Uses components which makes it easy to maintain code
-----------------------
Disadvantages of react
*   Steeper learning curve for complex applications
*   Not suitable for complex state management
-----------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
What are components?
Components are pieces of code that are used to perform a task and represent a unit of the UI 
They can be reused throughout the application
-----------------------
### React Components
Type of components:
*   Functional components
    They are JavaScript/Typescript Functions which return 1 html element at a time
    They get access to objects called as props
    AKA stateless components

*   Class components
    They are JavaScript/Typescript classes which has a render() which returns 1 html element at a time
    They get access to props and state
    AKA stateful components

What is JSX?
It stands for JavaScript and XML
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML in your JavaScript files. It
is a way to write HTML in your JavaScript code. It is not a separate language, but rather
a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is used to create React elements and is a key part of the
React library.
XML: Xtensible Markup language

###Props and State in react
-----------------------------
Props:
*   Props are short for properties
*   They are immutable objects
*   Data passed down from parent component to child component is called as props

State:
*   State is an object that stores data that can change
*   They are mutable objects
*   Data is stored in the component itself and can be changed at any time
*   State is used to store data that can change over time, such as user input or API data
*   Initialy state was only accessible inside class components but post React 16 version,
state is also accessible in functional components using hooks
