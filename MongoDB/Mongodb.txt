Aggregation Functions in Mongodb
----------------------------------------------------------
    Aggregation is a process of combining multiple documents into a single document
    Aggregation is a process of transforming data from one format to another
    Aggregation is a process of grouping data by one or more fields
    Aggregation is a process of applying various operations on the data
    Aggregation is a process of filtering data based on certain conditions

Stages of aggregation functions:
1. $match: This stage filters the documents based on a condition
2. $project: This stage selects the fields to be included in the output
3. $group: This stage groups the documents based on one or more fields
4. $sort: This stage sorts the documents based on one or more fields
5. $limit: This stage limits the number of documents in the output
6. $lookup: This stage joins two collections based on a common field
7. $unwind: This stage unwinds an array field into separate documents
