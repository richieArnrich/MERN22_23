          According to sweetmeat researcher Haripada Bhowmick, dela rasagulla
          was popular in Nabadwip and Phulia of Nadia. Sri Chaitanya loved this
          type of rasagulla a lot and the art of its making was spread to other
          regions during the Bhakti movement.

          The spongy, white rôśôgolla is believed to have been introduced in
          present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named
          Nobin Chandra Das.

          In 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son
          Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which
          made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside
          India.

          Today, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and
          Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the
          Indian subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name
          Rasbari.
